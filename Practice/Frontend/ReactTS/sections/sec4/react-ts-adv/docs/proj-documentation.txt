  Header component
    - The Header component provides a header with an image and custom text.
      Here, I created three props (src, alt, and children), which will be help 
      render image goals.jpg and our custom text into the UI.

  CourseGoal.tsx
   This component is responsible for rendering goals items (title and description).
   CoarseGoal props will pass into CourseGoalList as a child component.

  CourseGoalList.tsx
   Renders CourseGoal items passed as a list, with a delete button on every item.
   CourseGoalListProps accepts interface CoarseGoal as an array type. 
   CourseGoal interface is located under the models folders.

  NewGoal.tsx
   A component, which serves as form for adding new course goals entries.
   Here, we use useRef (instead of useState) for capturing input values.
   OnAddGoal props is a function for adding new goal items with two parameters:
   goal: string, and summary: string. Parameters which will take the user input 
   from the input fields.

  InfoBox.tsx
   - An alert-like component, which will pop alerts to the user, based on the state
     of the CourseGoalList length. 
   - For props, I used type discrimination union, to separate "warnings" from "hint" 
     alerts, through the 'mode' prop.
   - If mode is set to a hint, the hint css styling will be applied, if not, or if it's 
     a warning, then the warning CSS styling will be applied to the rendered element.
   - In warning, the 'severity' prop will decide the color of that alert rendered, based 
     on conditionals implemented for the CourseGoalList length.
