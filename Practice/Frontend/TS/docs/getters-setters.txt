Getters and setters
 - The main purpose of getters and setters is to encapsulate and protect private 
   members from being exposed and accessed outside their class.


class Player {
	// Properties
	private _id: string;
	public readonly first: string;
	public readonly last: string;
	public score: number = 0;
	protected _salary!: number;

	// getters
	get fullName(): string {
		return `${this.first} ${this.last}`;
	}
	get salary(): number {
		return this._salary;
	}

	// setters
	set salary(newSalary: number) {
		if (newSalary < 0) {
			throw new Error("Salary cannot be negative");
		}
		this._salary = newSalary;
	}

}
