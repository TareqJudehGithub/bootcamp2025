private
 - private modifier is a TS exclusive and it does not exist in JS.
 - private means, this property/method is only accessible without the class 
   it was created in, and it cannot be accessed from the outside.



 class Player {
	// Properties
	private _id: string;
	public readonly first: string;
	public readonly last: string;
	public score: number = 0;

	constructor(id: string, first: string, last: string, score: number) {
		this._id = id;
		this.first = first;
		this.last = last;
		this.score = score;
  }
  
  // methods
  public playerDetails(): string {
    return `Name: ${this.first} ${this.last}\nScore: ${this.score}`
  }
 

}

const elton = new Player("001", "Elton", "Steel", 0);
console.log(elton.first, elton.last, elton.score);
console.log(elton.playerDetails());
