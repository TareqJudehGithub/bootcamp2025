React.forwardRef

 React.forwardRef in conjunction with TypeScript enables type-safe ref 
 forwarding in React components.
 This allows a parent component to obtain a direct reference to a 
 DOM element or component instance rendered by a child component,
  even when the child is a functional component that doesn't inherently expose refs.



How to use forwardRef with TypeScript

- Define the component with React.forwardRef:   
  Wrap your functional component with React.forwardRef. 
  
      import React, { forwardRef, Ref } from 'react';

      const FancyButton = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, FancyButtonProps>(
        ({ children, onClick }, ref: Ref<HTMLButtonElement>) => (
          <button ref={ref} onClick={onClick}>
            {children}
          </button>
        )
      );
    
      interface FancyButtonProps {
        children: React.ReactNode;
        onClick?: () => void;
      }

      forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, FancyButtonProps>: This specifies the 
      types for forwardRef.
      HTMLButtonElement: This is the type of the DOM element that the ref will 
      point to (the underlying <button> element in this case).

      FancyButtonProps: This is the type of the component's props.
      ref: Ref<HTMLButtonElement>: The ref parameter in the render function is 
      explicitly typed as Ref<HTMLButtonElement>, ensuring type safety when 
      interacting with the forwarded ref.


    Key Points:
    Type Safety: TypeScript ensures that the ref passed and received has the correct 
    type, preventing common runtime errors.      

    Direct DOM Access: forwardRef allows direct access to the underlying DOM node or 
    component instance for imperative actions like focusing, triggering animations, or 
    measuring layout.

    Generics with forwardRef: When dealing with generic components, you might need to 
    employ type assertions or specific patterns to correctly infer and pass generic 
    types through forwardRef.
