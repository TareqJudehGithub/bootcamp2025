Type Narrowing
 - We use typeof Type Guards to 'type check' before working with a value.
 - Since unions (for example: string | number) allow multiple types for a value
   we can first check what came through before working with it.
 -  typeof is used for primitive types.
      function triple(value: number | string) {
        if (typeof value === "string") {
          console.log(`${value} is a string.`)
        }
      }
 - always coat the type value on the right side of the comparison with double ""

 - Truthiness Guard (truthiness check)
  - To check if a value exists using a conditional statement.
  
    const value;
    if (value) {
      do something based on the fact value is not null.
    }
