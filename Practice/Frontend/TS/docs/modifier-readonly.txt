readonly modifier
 - A modifier that strict users from modifying a primitive value.
 - readonly is TS exclusive, it does not exist in JS.

    type User = {
      readonly id: number;
      userName: string;
    };

    const user: User = {
      id: 1234,
      userName: "john45.smith",
    };

    // user.id = 324564;    Error cannot modify a readonly variable.
