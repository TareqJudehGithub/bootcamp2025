Compiling TS code into JS
After finishing writing our code in the .ts file (making sure we have no errors), we now
can compile that .ts file in the Terminal using the tsc command:
  $ tsc file-name.ts
This process generates a compiled .js file with the same .ts file name.

- Running $ tsc without specifying a filename, will compile all .ts files in that 
  directory.

tsconfig.json file
 - The file were all TS configurations and setting are kept
 - To create tsconfig.json, run:
   $ tsc --init
 - Next, we create all needed .ts files.
 - TS files ends with extension .ts
 - After finishing writing code in the .ts file, making sure we seeing no errors, we now 
   need to start compiling it to a JavaScript (JS) format, and for that run in the same 
   directory the .ts files in:
   $ tsc filename.ts


--watch attribute
 - --watch, dynamically watches any changes on the targeted .ts file and compiles it.
 - we can write it as --watch or -w
   $ tsc --watch filename.ts
 - TS starts 'watching' the target file for any changes, errors, and reports back in 
   the Terminal.


- Specify files to be compiled
 - For that we add: "files": ["filename1.ts", "filename2.ts"] right after 
   "compilerOptions" closing curly braces.
