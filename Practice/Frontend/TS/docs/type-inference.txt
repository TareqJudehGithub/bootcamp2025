TS Inference
  - TS can detect a variable type based on it's value assigned, and returns 
    errors in case we changed that variable value to another type.

    let isFunny = false;
    isFunny = true;
    isFunny = "false";

  - In case of a function defined without annotating it's return type and without 
    including a return keyword, TS will be expecting a 'void' return type here.
  - In case we did not annotate a return type, but we did include the return keyword,
    TS will infers and set a return type to that function based on it's return value.
