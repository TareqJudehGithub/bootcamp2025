Tuples
 - Tuples are special array type exclusive to TS (they don't exist in JS).
 - Tuples are arrays of FIXED lengths and ordered with specific types, like
   super rigid arrays.
 - In tuples, the length, the type, and also the order they all matter.  

 - An array of fixed numbers (3);
    const color: [number, number, number] = [255, 0, 255];
 - We can still push or pop an item (not the whole length), and that is 
   considered a limitation with tuples.
