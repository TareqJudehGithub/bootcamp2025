TypeScript (TS)
 
  What is TypeScript?
   - TypeScript is a programming language and a superset of JavaScript that adds 
     optional static typing (static checking).
   - TS is developed by Microsoft (MS) that is based on JS.
   - TS is a static type system.
   - Static checking is the process of detecting errors in our code before run-time.
   - TS Only exists in Development. TS is compiled to JS.
   
   - Using TS benefits:
    - Helps us find errors in our code, before run-time (code running in the browser).
    - Analyzes our code as we type.
