Type Alias
 - Instead of writing out object types in an annotation, we can declare
   them separately in a type alias.
 - Type alias allows us to make our code more readable and even gives us 
   the ability to reuse it elsewhere in our project.
 - It is a convention to use semi colon; between type members.

 - Example:   
  First we specify a type alias using the 'type' keyword
  The type variable is usually a PascalCase.

    type Point = {
      x: number;
      y: number;
    };

    function aliasFunc(point: Point): Point {
      return { x: point.x * 2, y: point.y * 2 };
    }
