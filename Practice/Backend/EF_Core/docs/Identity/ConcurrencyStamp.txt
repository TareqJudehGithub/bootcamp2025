  ConcurrencyStamp
    The ConcurrencyStamp in ASP.NET Core Identity is a unique string value used for 
    optimistic concurrency control. It ensures that data integrity is maintained when 
    multiple users or processes attempt to modify the same user or role record in the 
    database simultaneously, preventing silent data loss.
