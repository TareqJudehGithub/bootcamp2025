NormalizedName property

The NormalizedName property in ASP.NET Core Identity is a case-insensitive, uppercase 
version of the Name field for roles (IdentityRole) and the UserName and Email fields for 
users (IdentityUser). Its primary purpose is to provide a consistent, searchable format 
for identity lookups, ensuring that comparisons in the database are reliable and not 
affected by character casing. 

Purpose and Function
Case-Insensitive Lookups: ASP.NET Core Identity performs identity lookups (e.g., finding 
a user by username or email, or finding a role by name) using the normalized fields. 
This makes searching case-insensitive. For example, a search for the role "Admin" will 
match a role stored as "admin" if both have the same NormalizedName (which would 
typically be "ADMIN").

Database Efficiency: Storing a normalized version allows for the application of unique 
constraints and indexes at the database level, preventing duplicate entries that differ 
only in casing (e.g., both "User@example.com" and "user@example.com" would normalize to 
"USER@EXAMPLE.COM").

Internal Management: The Identity framework's managers, like UserManager and 
RoleManager, automatically calculate and set these normalized values when creating or 
updating users and roles. Developers generally don't need to manually set this property 
unless they are writing a custom storage provider from scratch.
