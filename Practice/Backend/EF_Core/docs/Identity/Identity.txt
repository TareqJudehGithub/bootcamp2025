ASP .NET Core IDentity
 - An API that supports user interface (UI) login
 - manages users, passwords, profile data, roles, claims, tokens, email confirmation,
   and more.
 - Supports external login providers like Facebook, Google, MS, and Twitter.
 
 - Choosing Individual User Accounts option as an Authentication type when creating 
   a new project, enables Identity features (tables and views).
 - In Program.cs calling UseAuthentication service enables Identity.
 - When authentication is successful, a claims principle is created to support 
   authorization decisions.
    - The Principal represents a programmatic collection of claims.
    - Claim are pieces of information about a user like username.

 - [Authorize] is used on a controller to restrict access to all actions in 
   the controller.
     - Can be places over a specific action.
     - Can include further restrictions based on roles, claims, and security 
       policies.
 - [AllowAnonymous] is used to allow anonymous access to a resource.
 
 - Why use Identity?
  - Includes several features:
    - User-related UI external login provider support, etc.
    - built on top of industry-standard security best practices:
      - Passwords hashing is automatic
    - Database structure: tables and helper services and methods for quick and 
      easy development.

 - In ApplicationDbContext.cs under Data folder:
   1- Create the roles
   2- Create the users
   3- Map the a user (defined in step 2-) to a role using Id
   -  The order of creating (seeding data) is important. Start with the roles, then
      follow that with the users, finishing with the mapping.
   4- Add-Migration and Update-Database
