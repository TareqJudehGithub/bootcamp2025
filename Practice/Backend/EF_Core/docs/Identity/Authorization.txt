Authorization
 - Determining wether a user has access to a resource or not.
 - Not ALL authenticated users might have access to to parts of an application. 
   For example, Admin panels should not be accessible to regular users.
 - Authorization is independent and happens after authentication. However, authenticated
   requires an authentication mechanism.
