0Loading related data

 Eager Loading
  - Related data is loaded from the database as part of the initial query.
  - use AsSplitQuery() as needed
  - Include() and Where()
  - If we are using Include(), this means we are using Eager Loading.  
 
 Explicit Loading
  - Related data is explicitly loaded from the database user.
  - Data can be explicitly loaded by executing a separate query.
  - We use DbContext.Entry()API
 
 Lazy Loading
  - Related data is loaded from the database accessing the navigation property.
  - Requires:
    Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies
    Enabled with the UseLazyLoadingProxies() added to DbContext config
    Navigation properties must be virtual.
