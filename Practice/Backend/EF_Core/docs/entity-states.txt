Entity States
EF Core entities can exist in one of five distinct states, which determine how the DbContext interacts with them and what actions are performed during SaveChanges(). These states are:
Added:
The entity is being tracked by the context but does not yet exist in the database.
When SaveChanges() is called, EF Core generates an INSERT statement to add the entity to the database.
Unchanged:
The entity is being tracked by the context and exists in the database.
Its property values have not changed from the values in the database.
SaveChanges() will not perform any action for Unchanged entities.
Modified:
The entity is being tracked by the context and exists in the database.
Some or all of its property values have been modified since it was loaded or attached to the context.
When SaveChanges() is called, EF Core generates an UPDATE statement to reflect the changes in the database.
Deleted:
The entity is being tracked by the context and exists in the database.
It has been marked for deletion from the database.
When SaveChanges() is called, EF Core generates a DELETE statement to remove the entity from the database.
Detached:
The entity is not currently being tracked by any DbContext instance.
This is the initial state of an entity before it is attached to a context, or after it has been explicitly detached or loaded using AsNoTracking(). 
SaveChanges() has no effect on Detached entities.
