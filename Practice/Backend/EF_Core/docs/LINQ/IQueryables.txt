IQueryable types
 Records stay as IQueryable until the ToListAsync() is executed, then the 
 final query is performed.

 - Represents a query that has not yet been executed against the database.
 - Allows for the deferred execution of queries, meaning the actual database interaction 
   is delayed until the data is explicitly requested.
 - Enables the construction of complex queries step-by-step, with LINQ expressions 
   being translated into optimized SQL by EF Core.
 - Filters, sorts, and projections applied to an IQueryable are translated into 
   corresponding SQL clauses and executed on the database server. This is generally 
   more efficient, especially for large datasets, as only the necessary data is retrieved.
