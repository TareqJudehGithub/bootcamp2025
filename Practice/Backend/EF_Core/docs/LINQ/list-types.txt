ToList() or ToListAsync()

 - After executing to ToListAsync(), the records are loaded into memory, and any 
 operation is then done in memory.

 - Always end your LINQ query with ToList() or ToListAsync in case of
   async/await.


ToList():
- Is an extension method that immediately executes the IQueryable query and 
  materializes the results into a List<T> in memory.
- Once ToList() is called, all subsequent operations (like filtering or sorting) are 
  performed in memory on the retrieved List<T>, not on the database.
- This can be less efficient for large datasets, as the entire dataset is loaded 
  into memory before any in-memory operations are applied.
