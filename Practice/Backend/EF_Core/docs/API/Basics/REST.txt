What is REST?
 - REST stands for Representation State Transfer
 - A style of architecture for building web services.
 - A set of principles that defines how web services should be 
   designed and how they interact with each other.
 
 REST is stateless
  - REST is a stateless client server model, meaning the server
    should not store any client state between these requests, and the client should provide these information with each and 
    every request.
  - This allows fo scalability readability, as the server can handle
    multiple requests at the same time, without the need to maintain 
    client state.
