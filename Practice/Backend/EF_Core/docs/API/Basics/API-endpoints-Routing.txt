API Endpoints
  - Also known as API controllers.
  - An API endpoint is a specific URL that receives requests and sends responses, combining
    a resource path with an HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

  Controller-based APIs
  - Controller-based APIs use classes that derive from ControllerBase to handle requests.
    Routing can be convention-based or, more commonly, attribute-based, where attributes 
    like [Route(...)] and [HttpGet] define the endpoint behavior. 

  [ApiController]
  [Route("api/[controller]")]
  public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
  {
      // GET: api/products
      [HttpGet]
      public ActionResult<IEnumerable<Product>> GetProducts()
      {
          // ... code to return list of products ...
      }

      // GET: api/products/5
      [HttpGet("{id}")]
      public ActionResult<Product> GetProduct(int id)
      {
          // ... code to return a specific product ...
      }
  }

   [Route("api/[controller]")]
    - Defines the route to the endpoint.
    - https://localhost/api/controllerName
         
  [ApiController]
    - Tells the application, that this controller is for API usage, and not an MVC 
      controller. So for example, the application will automatically validates the 
      model states and return a 200 response back.

Routing

 - Routing is the process of matching incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate 
  action methods that will handle those requests.

 - Routing is used to map the URL of a request to a controller and then its action 
   method.

  [HttpDelete("{id}")] 
  public IActionResult Delete(int id)
  {

  }

- The {id} from the URL is passed to the input parameter (int id) in the action method.

[Http*] tells your method which HTTP verb it handles.
[Route] defines custom paths and makes routing predictable.
[ApiController] turns on helpful features like model validation and automatic binding.
[FromBody], [FromQuery], and [FromRoute] specify exactly where data should come from.
 
 [FromBody]
  - Maps a parameter coming from another model (usually a DDO).

 [FromRoute]
  - Maps a parameter coming from a [Route()]
  - Both parameters in the method and the Route should match.
      Example:
      [Route("{id:guid}")]
        public IActionResult Update([FromRoute] Guid id)
        {
          // Method body
          
        }
