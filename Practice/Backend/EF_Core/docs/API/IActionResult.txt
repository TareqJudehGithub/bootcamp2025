IActionResult helpers

 Return Ok()   
  - Returns 200 response
  - You can return an empty 200 response with return Ok(); or return data along with 
    the 200 status using return Ok(data);

 Return CreateAtAction() 
  - A method used in [HttpPost] Create endpoints action.
  - Returns an HTTP 201 Created status code.
  - It indicates that a new resource has been successfully created and provides the 
    client with the URI of the new resource in a Location header.   
  - providing a clear and standard response for resource creation, which Ok() (HTTP 200) 
    does not.
  - The Location header automatically includes the URL where the newly created resource 
    can be accessed via an HTTP GET request,  allowing the client to immediately 
    retrieve the resource without guessing the URL.  
  - Validation: The method validates that the target action (the one used to build the 
    location URL) exists, providing a safer and more reliable way to generate the URI than 
    manually hard-coding a string.
