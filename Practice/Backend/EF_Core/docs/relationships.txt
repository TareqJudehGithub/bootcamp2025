Entity Relationships in EF
  - One to many
    - One record is related to, or referenced by several others.
    - Parent entity should have a collection of the related entities.
    - Related entity or child, should have FK and navigation properties
      representing the parent.
    - Use nullable types for optional relationships.
  - By using conventions, the relationship will be discovered by EF Core.
