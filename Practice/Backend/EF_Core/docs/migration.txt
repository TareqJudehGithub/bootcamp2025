Database Migration

 - Migration is used to control changes to the database. Entity or Context
   changes.
 - Applied using Update-Database command in Package Manager(PM) Console.
 - Can be rolled back.
 - Tracked in source control.
 - Database changes are tracked in the _EFMigrationsHistory table.
 - Can be replayed to create a database at anytime.

 
Migration from .Net to SQL Server
 
Install package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools from NuGet, in order
to be able to use Package Manager Console in VS.

Add Project Reference between Console project and .Data project.

Make the Console project your startup project in VS.
1 - In Package Manager(PM) Console, and from Default Project dropdown menu, make
  sure the 'Data' project is the default 'selected' project.

2 - In the Console PM run: $ Add-Migration InitialMigration
 - This will start building up the migration file for us, in the Migration
   folder inside the Data project.
    If all went well: 
        Build started...
        Build succeeded.
        To undo this action, use Remove-Migration.

3- Finally run,  Update-Database
   This command should create the database and the tables (model class properties).
  If all went well: 
    Build started...
    Build succeeded.
    Applying migration '20251019213306_InitialMigration'.
    Done.
