Razor Pages
  - Razer Pages can make coding page-focused scenarios easier and more productive
    than using controllers and views.
    
  - Razer Pages uses razor views (.cshtml)  
      - @page must be the first line of the view. It makes the file into an MVC action,
        so it can handle requests directly without going through a controller.

  - Features a code behind-file with default methods for GET and POST operations.
  - Features a code behind the view fil for logic (no controllers)  
  - Code behind file features handlers for routing logic (no actions)
  - Models can be defined in code behind the view file nd bound to the 
    form (view model files)
  - Reduces file and folders (compared to MVC) and is a simpler way to organize 
    logic, views and model.

  - When to use Razor Pages?
    Choose Razor Pages if building a new application with mostly page-based 
    functionality, or for adding simple, self-contained features to an existing 
    application. They are also a good default choice for new page-based functionality.
