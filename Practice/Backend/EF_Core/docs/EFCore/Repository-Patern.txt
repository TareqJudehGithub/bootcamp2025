Repository Pattern
  - The Repository Pattern in ASP.NET Core is a design pattern that abstracts 
    the data access ayer, mediating between the domain/business logic and the 
    underlying data storage mechanism (e.g., EF Core).
  - Repository pattern encapsulates the logic for retrieving, storing, and manipulating 
    data, allowing the application's business logic to remain independent of the data 
    access specifics. 
  - Through the Repository pattern, we connect or contact the database, and not through 
    the view model. The repository should contact the Domain Model only.
  Key Concepts:
   Abstraction of Data Access: Repositories hide the details of how data is persisted 
   and retrieved. This means the business logic doesn't need to know if data comes 
   from a relational database, a NoSQL database, or an external service.

  Separation of Concerns: It promotes a clean separation between the data access layer 
  and the business logic layer, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.

  Testability: By providing an interface for data access, repositories make it easier 
  to mock data access operations during unit testing, isolating the business logic for 
  more effective testing.

  Flexibility and Maintainability: Changes to the data storage mechanism 
  (e.g., switching databases) can be made within the repository layer without impacting 
  the rest of the application.


  Configuring the Repository in a project

  - Create a new Repositories or Services folder.
  - Inside the new folder created in the previous step, Create a new interface
    for abstracted method (CRUD method operations)
  - Implement the abstracted method in a new class created under the same folder
      Repositories
        - IServiceLayer.cs
        - ServiceLayer.cs
  - Inject the new Interface and its Implementation class in Program.cs
    using AddScoped service.
      - builder.Services.AddScoped<IServiceLayer, ServiceLayer>();
  
  - Inside ServiceLayer.cs:
    - Inject DBContext class with the class constructor.
        #region Fields
        private readonly BloggieDbContext _dbContext;
        #endregion
        #region Constructor
        // Constructor injection
        public TagRepository(BloggieDbContext dbContext)
        {
            _dbContext = dbContext;
        }

    - Build every CRUD method inside the class.
  
  - Inside the designated controller:
    - Inject the IServiceLayer with the class constructor.
    - Use _serviceLayer to extract every method implemented inside the 
      ServiceLayer class.
