Entity Framework EF Core

  - EF Core is an open-source ORM library with APIs that make it easy to interact
    with our database.
  - EF Core increases productivity while eliminating repeating code and allowing
    you to connect to many data stores while retaining a consistent code base.
  - Used in millions of applications and is stable, robust, a high-performance
    enough to handle extreme workload applications.

  EF Core Patterns:
   
   Code First
    - Uses classes to model the entity (table) 
    - Generate database and tables based on code.
    - Updates are made through migrations.

   Database First
    - Connect to and model an existing database (reverse engineering)
    - Classes are generated to match the existing database.
    - When updates are made to the database, the process must be repeated
      to regenerate models.


EF Core Key Components
  Database Adapter
    For Microsoft, we use MS SQL Server
  Database Context 
    A class that represents the database model in code
  Data models
    Classes that represent tables and structures

Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
  - LINQ in written in C#, converted to SQL for database execution
  - Can be used for non-database operations, like on regular lists/collections.
