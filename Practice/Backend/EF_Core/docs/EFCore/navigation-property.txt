Navigation
  - Navigations are layered over foreign keys to provide a natural, object-oriented 
    view for reading and manipulating relationships.
  - EF Core navigation properties are properties defined within entity classes that 
    represent relationships between those entities.
  - They allow for easy traversal and management of related data within an application.  

  There are two main types of navigation properties:
   - Reference Navigation Properties
    - These properties represent one-to-one or one-to-many relationships, where the 
      current entity refers to a single instance of another entity.
      For example, a Customer entity might have a BillingAddress property of type 
      Address, representing a one-to-one relationship.
      
        public class Order
        {
            public int OrderId { get; set; }
            public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
            public int CustomerId { get; set; }

            // Reference Navigation Property
            public Customer Customer { get; set; } 
        }

   - Collection Navigation Properties
    - These properties represent one-to-many or many-to-many relationships, where the 
      current entity is associated with a collection of other entities.
      For example, a Customer entity might have an Orders property of type
      ICollection<Order>, representing a one-to-many relationship.

          public class Customer
          {
              public int CustomerId { get; set; }
              public string Name { get; set; }

              // Collection Navigation Property
              public ICollection<Order> Orders { get; set; } 
          }

  - Navigation properties are crucial for:

- Navigation properties are crucial for:  
 - Defining relationships: They explicitly declare the connections between different 
   entities in your model.
 - Loading related data: EF Core can use navigation properties to load associated 
   entities through eager, explicit, or lazy loading.
 - Simplifying data manipulation: They enable intuitive access and modification of 
   related data without manually managing foreign keys.
