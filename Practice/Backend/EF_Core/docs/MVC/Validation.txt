Validations
  - Model validation occurs after model binding.
  - Validation reports errors where data doesn't conform to business rules.
  -  Model validation occurs before the execution of a controller action.
  
  - Validation attributes (annotation) let you specify validating rules for
    model properties.
  - Annotation or custom validation should be included in the View Model, and not 
    the Model it self.
  
  - Client-side validation
    - Avoid unnecessary round top to the server when input errors occur on a form.
    - The jQuery Unobtrustive Validation script is a custom MS frontend library that
      builds on the popular Query Validation plugin.
      - Added by the _ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml
