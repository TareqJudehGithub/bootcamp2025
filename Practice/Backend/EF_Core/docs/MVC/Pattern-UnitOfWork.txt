Unit of Work Pattern (UoW)
 - A behavioral pattern in software development, which helps us encapsulate
   multiple data related operations into one thing.
 - When the operations are finished, we want all or nothing.
    - All the work must be successful or fail.
    - Like a database transaction
 - Essential for maintaining *ACID principles in a database
 









ACID is a set of principles that guarantee the reliability of database 
transactions, standing for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 
These principles ensure that a transaction is processed as a single, 
all-or-nothing unit, maintaining data integrity and correctness even in the 
event of system failures.
