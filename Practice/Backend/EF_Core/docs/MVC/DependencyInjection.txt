Dependency Injection (DI)
 - A software design pattern and a technique for achieving 
 inversion of control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies.

 - Dependency: An object that another object depend on. For example,
   the Controller depends on the DbContext.
 - A class can create an instance of a dependency class to use the methods.
   For example, the Controller uses the data access methods from the database
   context class.

 Why use DI?
  - Objects are disposed of automatically.
    - Manual instantiating requires more deliberate effort to prevent memory leaks. 
  - Easier long-term maintenance of application code.
  - Keeps the codebase SOLID - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should 
      depend on abstractions like interfaces or abstract classes.   
    - This principle promotes decoupling by inverting the direction of dependency,
      making code more flexible, maintainable, and testable.
    - High-level components (business logic) and low-level components (e.g., 
      database access) should both rely on an abstraction, which is then implemented 
      by the low-level component.
