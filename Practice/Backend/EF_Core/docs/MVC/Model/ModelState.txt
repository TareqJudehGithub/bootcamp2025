ModelState
  - The model state represents errors from the model binding and from the model 
    validation subsystems.
  - For web apps, it's the app's responsibility to inspect ModelState.IsValid and
    react appropriately.
  - Errors can be added to the ModelState manually in the action.
    - For example, calculate some value.. etc.
    - This error can be added to the ModelState to fail the validation.
