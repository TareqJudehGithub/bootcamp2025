Model
 - A C# class that contains properties to store data needed for an operation.
 - Strongly typed views typically use ViewModel types designed to contain 
   data to display on that view.
 - The controller creates and populates these ViewModel objects from the model.
 - ASP .NET Core MVC uses 'model binding' to convert request data (from values, query 
   string parameters, etc.) into objects that the controller can handle.
