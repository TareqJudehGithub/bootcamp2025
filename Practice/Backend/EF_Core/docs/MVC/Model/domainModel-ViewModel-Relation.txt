In .NET Core MVC, the relationship between the Domain Model and View Model can be 
visualized as follows:


+-----------------+      +-----------------+      +-----------------+
|   Domain Model  |----->|   Controller    |----->|    View Model   |
| (Business Logic)|      | (Orchestration) |      | (Presentation)  |
+-----------------+      +-----------------+      +-----------------+
        ^                                                |
        |                                                |
        |                                                V
        +------------------------------------------------+
                               |
                               V
                          +---------+
                          |   View  |
                          | (UI Layer)|
                          +---------+
Explanation:
Domain Model:
Represents the core business entities and logic of the application.
Contains data and behavior related to the problem domain (e.g., Product, Order, Customer).
Is independent of the UI and presentation concerns.
Often persists to a database or other data store.
Controller:
Receives user requests from the View.
Interacts with the Domain Model to perform business operations (e.g., retrieve data, save
changes).
Maps data from the Domain Model to the appropriate View Model.
Selects the correct View to render and passes the View Model to it.
View Model:
A class specifically designed to hold data required by a particular View.
Contains only the data necessary for the View to display, potentially aggregated or 
transformed from the Domain Model.
Can include properties for UI-specific concerns like formatting, validation messages, or 
dropdown list options.
Decouples the View from the complexities of the Domain Model, promoting separation of 
concerns.
View:
The UI layer responsible for displaying information to the user.
Receives a View Model from the Controller.
Renders the data from the View Model, typically using Razor syntax in .NET Core MVC.
Does not directly interact with the Domain Model.
Key Principles:
Separation of Concerns: The Domain Model focuses on business logic, the View Model on 
presentation data, and the View on UI rendering.
Data Transformation: The Controller acts as a bridge, transforming data between the 
Domain Model and the View Model as needed.
Loose Coupling: Changes to the UI or presentation logic (View and View Model) should 
ideally not impact the core business logic (Domain Model), and vice-versa.
