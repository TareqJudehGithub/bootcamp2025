Controllers
 - Controllers handle requests, work with the model, and selects a view to render.
 - Views only display information, so the Controller:
  - handles a user request (HTTP request)
  - Invokes a method called an 'action'
  - Performs business logic as needed (from that action method)
  - After that, the action returns a view (a response) with the relevant data
    rendering its corresponding view.
