Service Layer
 - A level of abstraction for business login
 - Allows all logic related to a module to be implemented
 - Removes concerns from Controllers, allowing them to focus on directing
   web traffic.
 - Includes a contract (interface) and an implementation (class)
 - All dependencies for the module will be injected here.

 - It is reasonable to use EF Core directly (like in the service layer) and
   directly access all features for database accesses.
