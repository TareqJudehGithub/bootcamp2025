Repository Pattern (Rep)
 - A design pattern to separate the data access layer from the application
 - Used to abstract data access
 - Provides interface without exposing implementation
 - Typically used within the Service layer to handle data retrieval
   and persistence
 - A service layer can access/query multiple repositories
 - It hides all the data-related operations from other layers.
 - Each repository will only be responsible for a single model/table.


 - Repository pattern benefits
  - Decoupling
   - Decoupling the data access layer from the rest of the application, which makes it
     easier to maintain and test the application.
  - Consistency
  - Performance
  - Multiple data sources(switching)
