Repository Pattern (Rep)
 - Used to abstract data access
 - Typically used within the Service layer to handle data retrieval
   and persistence
 - A service layer can access/query multiple repositories
 - It hides all the data-related operations from other layers.
 - Each repository will only be responsible for a single model/table.
