Dependency Injection (DI)

  - DI is a technique for achieving loose coupling between object and their dependencies.
  - Loose coupling is a software design principle where components or modules of a system
    are designed to be largely independent of each other. Like for example, the DB 
    Context injecting the _mapper.
    

  Scoped vs Transient bs Singleton
    - AddTransient 
      - Services are created each time they are requested.
      - This lifetime works best for lightweight stateless services.
    - AddScoped 
      - Created once per request.
      - EF Core is automatically registered as an AddScoped service.
    - AddSingelton
      - Created the first time they are requested and then every subsequent request
        will use the same instance.
      - Good for static resources, like a file that has to be available all the time.
