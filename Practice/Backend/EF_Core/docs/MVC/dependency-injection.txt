Dependency Injection (DI)

  - DI is a technique for achieving loose coupling between object and their dependencies.
  - Loose coupling is a software design principle where components or modules of a system
    are designed to be largely independent of each other. Like for example, the DB 
    Context injecting the _mapper.
    
  - A design pattern to increase maintainability and testability
  - DI is built into ASP.NET Core
  - DI manages the life time of and dependencies of services used throughout the 
    application.
  - Instead of instantiating new object of a class, these dependencies are passed to that 
    class (as parameters to the constructor). This a allows for a greater 
    flexibility in a way objects are created and managed, and easier testing of 
    individual components.

  - DI container is responsible for creating and managing instances when the application
    starts.

  Scoped vs Transient bs Singleton
    - AddTransient 
      - Services are created each time they are requested.
      - This lifetime works best for lightweight stateless services.
    - AddScoped 
      - Created once per request.
      - EF Core is automatically registered as an AddScoped service.
    - AddSingelton
      - Created the first time they are requested and then every subsequent request
        will use the same instance.
      - Good for static resources, like a file that has to be available all the time.
