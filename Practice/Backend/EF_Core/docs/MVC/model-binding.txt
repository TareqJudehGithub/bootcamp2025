Model Binding
 - Controllers work with data coming from HTTP requests.
 - The incoming data is automatically bound to the matching properties.
    - Field names can also be bound to C# variables with MATCHING names 
      defined in the action parameters.
 - Forms can be generated from a model.
 - Form controls are automatically created BASED on the data type of the 
   property being captured.
 - ASP.NET Core provides Tag Helpers to enable server-side code to participate 
   in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. For example, the <input>
   element contains the asp-for attribute. This attribute binds the control to the 
   name of model's property and facilitates the model binding.
 
 - The <form> tag helper automatically generates a hidden Request Verification Token
   to prevent cross-site request forgery. This binds to the [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
   attribute above the POST action method.

 - asp-controller tag helper defines which controller you want to go to.
 - asp-action tag helper defines the form action destination.
