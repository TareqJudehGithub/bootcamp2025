SelectListItem
  The SelectListItem class in ASP.NET Core MVC (found in the 
  Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering namespace) is a fundamental component used to 
  represent individual items within a dropdown list (HTML <select>) or other 
  selection-based UI elements.

  Key properties of the SelectListItem class:
  - Text: Gets or sets the display text of the item in the dropdown list. This is 
    what the user sees.
  - Value: Gets or sets the value associated with the item. This value is typically 
    submitted to the server when the form is posted.
  - Selected: Gets or sets a boolean value indicating whether this item should be 
    pre-selected when the dropdown list is rendered.  
  - Disabled: Gets or sets a boolean value indicating whether this item should be 
    disabled in the dropdown list, preventing the user from selecting it.  

  - Group: Represents the optgroup HTML element this item is wrapped into. This allows
    for grouping related items within a dropdown. The Group property is of type 
    SelectListGroup.  

  Constructors:
    The SelectListItem class provides several constructors for convenient 
    initialization, including:  
     - SelectListItem(): Initializes a new instance of SelectListItem.
     - SelectListItem(String, String, Boolean): Initializes a new instance with text, 
       value, and a boolean indicating if it's selected.
     - SelectListItem(String, String, Boolean, Boolean): Initializes a new instance 
       with text, value, and booleans for selected and disabled states.  

  Usage:
    Typically, you would create a List<SelectListItem> in your controller or service and 
    pass it to the view, which then uses a Tag Helper (like asp-items) or an HTML 
    Helper (like Html.DropDownListFor) to render the dropdown list.
