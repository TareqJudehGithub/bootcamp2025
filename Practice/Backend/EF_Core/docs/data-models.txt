Data Models
 - Data models are classes that are used to model what the table will look like.
 - The properties defined inside a class, will become a table in the database.
 - Each property datatype is mapped to the matching SQL datatype.
 - EF Core uses certain naming convection to make assumptions. So if 
   a property was named Id, EF Core will automatically assume this is a PK of the 
   table.

Datatype mapping:
 
 property         Column
 iD               PK
 string           VARCHAR
