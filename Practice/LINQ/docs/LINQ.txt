Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
  - What is LINQ?
   - A set of technologies that allow a simple and efficient querying over different
     kinds of data.
   - LINQ works efficiently with collections (for example lists).
   - LINQ works with databases (SQL queries). LINQ C# code is transferred into 
     SQL queries upon execution.

  Benefits of LINQ
   - Clean, readable, and short.
   - A simple, efficient, and unified way of querying over different types of 
     data which is optimal for performance point of view.
   - Queries execute only when the result is required.
   
 Setting up LINQ in EF Core

 In the .Program.cs under Console project:
 
  using EntityFrameworkCore.Data;

  // Create new instance of context - FootballLeagueDbContext
  var context = new FootballLeagueDbContext();


  // Select * from Teams

  // Look at the Teams, convert it to List, then we can start querying.
  var teams = context.Teams.ToList();
